üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

This project is built entirely with modern, declarative Apple frameworks.

‚Ä¢
SwiftUI: The entire user interface is built using Apple's declarative UI framework, ensuring a reactive and consistent experience.

‚Ä¢
UserNotifications Framework: Powers the local push notifications for watering reminders.

‚Ä¢
Swift: The core programming language used for the application logic.

‚öôÔ∏è App Architecture

The app follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture pattern to separate the UI (View) from the business logic (ViewModel) and the data structures (Model).

‚Ä¢
Model (Plant.swift): Defines the data structure for a plant, including its properties like name, room, light, and watering schedule.

‚Ä¢
View (PlantListView.swift, etc.): SwiftUI views responsible for displaying the user interface and capturing user input.

‚Ä¢
ViewModel (PlantListViewModel.swift): Acts as the brain of the view, handling all the business logic, managing the state of the plants array, and communicating between the Model and the View.
